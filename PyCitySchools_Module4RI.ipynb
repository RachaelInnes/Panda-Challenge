    "---LOCAL AREA GOVERNMENT AREA SUMMARY\n",
    "    Analysis was undertaken using data from Local Area government schools on a number of variables, such as School Type (Government or Independant),  Budget, Academic peformance (Maths and Reading Pass rates) and size (Number of students) to conduct draw insights into the relationships that may exist between these factors. At a high level, the analysis shows:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  -The overall pass rate for all schools in the Local Government Area is 72.8%.\n",
    "  -Bailey High Shcool has the highest overall pass rate of 80.04%, this school also has the largest student population (4976).\n",
    "  -In terms of academic performance, there are four Independant schools in the Top 5, and one government school of the %of Overall Passing students (Maths and Reading scores at 50% or above) and four government schools and one Indpedant schools in the bottom 5 of this group.\n",
    "  -In terms of Reading and Maths scores by Year Level across Schools, students tend to peform consistently in both Reading and Maths across each year.\n",
    "  -There is little difference between the size of the school and the academic perforamnce, all are fairly similar (7 - 74% overall passing rate).\n",
    "  \n",
    "There are two conclusions that could be drawn from this data, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Type of school does correlate with academic performance. From this data there is higher overall passing rates in Indpendant Schools (76.97%) than Government Schools (70.69%). This seems to be attributed to higher levels of passing in the ratio of of students in Independant Schools passing maths).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The overall Budget and Per Student Budget does not have a correlation with academic performance (% Overall Passing Rates), this is obvious where the Top 2 Performing Schools have very different budgets. That is Bailey High School with a budget of 3.1m compared to Carbera with just over 1m budget. \n",
